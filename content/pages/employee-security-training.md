      By preventing or minimizing damage from security breaches, your business
      can stay protected against the ever-evolving threat landscape. Your
      employees can be your strongest defense against data breaches. Make sure
      they’re prepared!


      ## *Why Your Company Needs Employee Security Training*


      With cyber crime on the rise, it’s more important than ever to make sure
      your employees are properly trained in cybersecurity best practices. The
      average cost of a data breach for a small to medium-sized business is
      $108,000, and many businesses never recover.


      Whether you’re looking to teach your employees how to avoid becoming a
      phishing victim or need advanced security training for your IT team,
      Cygence Technology has the solutions to help keep your business protected
      against cybercrime.
